From my experience [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2367) tends to be a little bit underwhelming. While I find the ability to get info on your enemy very helpful, the DC tends to be very high and the knowledge check very difficult in itself. That's why I want to change four degrees of success into:

**Critical Success** You recall the knowledge accurately. The GM answers your question truthfully and either tells you additional information or context, or answers one follow-up question.<br>**Success** You recall the knowledge accurately. The GM answers your question truthfully.<br>**Failure** While you fail to recall the knowledge about the aspect of the enemy you wanted to, you still notice something about the enemy. The GM provides with small amount of information about the enemy, unrelated to your question.<br>**Critical Failure** You recall incorrect information. The GM decides to either answers your question falsely or give you no information..
